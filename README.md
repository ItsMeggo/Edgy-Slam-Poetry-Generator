# Edgy-Slam-Poetry-Generator
Based on the Shadow the Hedgehog video game endings.

This project will generate a poem from the 326 endings of the Shadow the Hedgehog videogame. Choose three numbers between 1 and 326 to get your poem.
Myself and my friends do this sometimes anyway, but I thought it would be fun to make a program that does it for you.

The code is working on my end at the moment. I'm not sure how well it will work for someone else, I need to fix up how the excel file is found by the code.

There's also some bugs that need fixing, such as if the user unputs a number larger than 326. I will fix these in the future! I would also like the poem output to be tidier, rather than just a list.
